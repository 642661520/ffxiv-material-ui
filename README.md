## Disclaimers

Use of this program is at your own risk. Square Enix does not permit the use of any third party tools, even those which do not modify the game. They have stated in interviews that they did not view parsers as a significant problem unless players use them to harass other players

## FAQ

**Can you change the color of the HP/MP/Gauge bars?**

Not currently. It's not that there's no way out, but it's not very encouraging. More than anything else, you can't get the color you want perfectly.

## Special thanks
